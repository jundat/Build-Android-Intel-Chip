# Build-Android-Intel-Chip
Unity (now is version 4.5.x) is not support building to Android device with Intel chip. So you can not Build And Run on Asus Zenfone 5. It's so uncomfortable to build APK file and then copy to device to run... This packe provice a menu command for Unity to build and deploy to these Intel Android device automatically... Of course, it will run ok for ARM Android device.
